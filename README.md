# AOC 2024
Advent of code 2024 in C++ because I'm a glutton for punishment apparently.

## Compiling
To build all solutions, assuming you are starting from the project directory:
```
cmake -B build .
cmake --build build
```

## Running
All compiled solutions will be in `build/bin/`. Paths to the input files are 
relative to the top-level project directory, so call from there. Here is how you
would run the day 1 solution:

```
./build/bin/day01
```
